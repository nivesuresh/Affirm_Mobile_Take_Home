* How long did you spend working on the problem? What did you find to be the most difficult part?

I spent about 3-4 hours (broken out) total on the problem. I found setting up the architecture to be the most difficult part since I was trying to set up all the components, modules, dagger injections, interfaces, etc., but it was getting too complicated for a short project. So I had to reconvene and keep it simple with a presenter and a view.

* What trade-offs did you make? What did you choose to spend time on, and what did you decide to not do for the sake of completing the project? 

I chose to spend time on:
  1. Making the UI look good: the images are all of the same size
  2. Making sure we have a clean enough MVP architecture
  3. Parsing the endpoint and displaying the images
  4. Adding in a search view
  5. Using the search view to query the endpoint based on search text
  6. Pagination

I did not spend time on:
  1. Having an empty-state screen 
  2. Hiding the keyboard once we hit "submit" on the search button
  3. Making the search view look/ feel better
  4. Having the app creatively pleasing to look at

* If you finished with extra time, what improvements did you make that go above and beyond the requirements? 

I definitely spent a little time trying to make the UI look and feel better - before I made each image a perfect square, they were in different sizes and they didn't look like a photo gallery or a Facebook/ Twitter photo album.
